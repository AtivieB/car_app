    "## Question\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Complete the following steps:\n",
    "Write a Python app that has the following classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "A super class called Vehicle, which contains an attribute for vehicle type, such as car, truck, plane, boat, or a broomstick.\n",
    "A class called Automobile which will inherit the attributes from Vehicle and also contain the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- year\n",
    "- make\n",
    "- model\n",
    "- doors (2 or 4)\n",
    "- roof (solid or sun roof).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Write an app that will accept user input for a car. The app will store \"car\" into the vehicle type in your Vehicle super class.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The app will then ask the user for the year, make, model, doors, and type of roof and store thdata in the attributes above.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The app will then output the data in an easy-to-read and understandable format, such as this:\n",
    ">  -  Vehicle type: car\n",
    " \n",
    ">   - Year: 2022\n",
    "> \n",
    "  >   - Make: Toyota\n",
    "> \n",
    "  > - Model: Corolla\n",
    "> \n",
    "  > - Number of doors: 4\n",
    "> \n",
    "  > - Type of roof: sun roof\n"
